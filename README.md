i had to  run the python code.But since the chal.pyc file was in file pyc format that means it is a compiled output file generated from source code written in Python programming language. 
so i opened it we need to use a decompiler and i searched for a pyc file decompiler and found one and decompiled it.
And ater decompiling it i got a python code and the password was already given so i need to reverse it
so i copy pasted the python code and password into chatgpt and ask it find the way that leads to the password
it changed the python code which i copied it and pasted it in the online compiler which gave mw the flag
